# PDAL Independent Exploration

For the final ~1.25 hours of the workshop, participants will be asked to take what they've learned during the course of the day, and to use PDAL to explore building a processing workflow. This is a chance to internalize what you've learned, and to think about how you'd apply PDAL to your specific datasets, application, or reseach objective.

As we near the end of the session, we'll ask you to upload a couple of screen captures / images / brief summary of what you did, and what you learned. Show us pretty pictures, successes, failures, problems, challenges, etc. The point is to share with each other and learn from each other's experiences.
